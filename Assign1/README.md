# CS1XA3
Assignment 1 - Project Analyzer

1. Uses git status uall which tells us if we our commit is ahead or not.By this we can know that our local repository is whether same as remote repo.I foud it on stack overflow.


2. Puts the output of git diff into changes.log in order to show any uncommited changes.

Was confused at first but I did not copied I just confirmed from this user.

3. Using Grep command we search for "#TODO" excluding  the todo.log and ProjectAnalyze.sh and place the results into todo.log.

4. Using the command provided in hint first we basically search for haskell files and check them for errors and we move all errors to error.log

Was getting things wrong just added the last part of the command rest everything was done by me.
